TODO:
- [ ] CRC checksum (library)
- [ ] Error detection
- [ ] Random packet delay (Maybe done)
- [ ] Performance Charts 
- [ ] Measure and compare the impact of various delay ranges on:
-  Total transmission time
-  Number of retransmissions
-  Number of duplicate ACKs received
- [ ] Implement an adaptive timeout mechanism that dynamically adjusts the
retransmission timer based on observed delay trends.

- [ ] GUI 
- [ ] Progress bar
- [ ] Multithreading(Maybe have sender and recieve as its own subprocess)
